# 12 Commandments for Devs

STOP MISTAKING MOTION FOR IMPACT
OBEDIENCE IS NOT COMPETENCE
BUILD SYSTEMS THAT OUTLIVE YOU
WRITE CODE FOR THE NEXT DEVELOPER
AUTOMATE YOUR PAIN
MAKE ARCHITECTURE SERVE REALITY
KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS
LEARN THE BUSINESS
NEVER WORSHIP TOOLS
GUARD YOUR BOUNDARIES
REST BEFORE YOU’RE FORCED TO
REMEMBER YOU’RE HUMAN
