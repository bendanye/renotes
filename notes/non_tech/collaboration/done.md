# It ain't over till it's done

Have you ever come across the situation when you walked up to the story wall, picked up your story and proudly moved it to Done state? Moments later, the tester comes to you and asks "is it deployed on the Test server, so that I can test that?", the Scrum Master asks "has that shown to the Product Owner?" Another dev asks "are there still pending tests cases to commit 'cause I see some of them missing here". And you response was probably: "No"?

Scrum provides the Definition of DONE (DoD), which is a shared checklist of criteria for a story to be considered DONE. Tasks in the definition are mutually agreed between the development team and the Product Owner.
