# If it hurts, do it more often

Formally, you have a quarterly deployment to production. Informally, the last three attempted deployments caused so much unforeseen problems and downtime that no amount of testing is now enough to confidently deploy. Key stakeholders book their vacations so as to not be around at release time. Getting sign-off takes months. Releases are cumulative, so each missed release increases the risk of the next one. The last five release windows were missed because of this. The organization is paralyzed, no code has made it to production in over a year.
