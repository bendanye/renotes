# Done = Live!

Whenever there is a strong separation between development, QA and operations, developers are often unaware of the problems and issues that are encountered when the software is put in production. In these situation, the developer assumes that the work is done after the checked changes are checked in into the version management system and marked as resolved in the issue tracking system. But until the change is in production, it is unsure whether the work is really finished.
