# How To Become a Good Programmer - David Heinemer Hansson (creator of Ruby On Rails)

1. Read a lot of code / software
2. Write a lot of code / software
3. Practice, practice, practice
4. The first time you write a piece of code, that's your first draft
5. First drafts are usually terrible
6. Rewrite code from step 4 and find ways to improve it
7. Find time to sit down and simplify your code
8. Strive for readability and clarity
9. Omit needless concepts, patterns, practices, classes, and all the extra things that are not getting you closer to clarity
10. Focus on the piece of code that's in front of you - how can I write it simpler?
