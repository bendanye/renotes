# Beyond Developer • Dan North • GOTO 2017

* Stakeholders are people whose lives you touch.
* If you write software for a bank, learn how a bank works.  If you work for a store, shop in that store.
* To understand what program you're writing, see if you can write the "Read Me" instructions and the FAQs first.
* Not everything needs to be automated. If it changes every time you do it, don't automate it. If doing it becomes boring, DO automate it.
