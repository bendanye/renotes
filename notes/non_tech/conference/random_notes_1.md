## GOTO Conference - Fewer Things, More Done

- **Deliver Highest Priority Features First**  
  - Donâ€™t treat priority 1 and priority 5 the same

  - Benefit now is worth more than benefit in the future

- **Deliver Value Along the Way**  
  - Deliver increments along the way instead of everything at the end

- **Deliver Value More Efficiently**  
  - Multiple engineers can unblock one another
