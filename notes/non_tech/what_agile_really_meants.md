# What Agile really meants

These few simple steps are really what agile is all about. Stick with these basics and you can apply them to all parts of software development:

- When writing code, do it in an agile way. Decide what you want to achieve, do a small change, test it, learn from it, adjust and repeat. Try to write code that's easy to change later.

- When building a product, do it in an agile way. Do small changes, get immediate feedback, do small iterations and make decisions that allow future changes as much as possible
