# Two Minutes Rule

You know the situation. Your co-worker does not use the keyboard anymore, and looks worried. There is a lot of sighs. Nothing happens. Then there is "Google to the rescue". Evidently, someone is trying to solve some problem, but is simply stuck. Everyone knows that just explaining the problem to others frequently helps to solve the problem on the spot! In other cases, there are other team members that have the solution ready at hand.

Think about the implication to the team's output. You are wasting time. Velocity drops. You can learn, but faster! Ask other team members to help!
