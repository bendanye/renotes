# Be Curious

## Motivation

Four reasons why curiosity is important:

### It makes your mind active instead of passive

Curious people always ask questions and search for answers in their minds. Their minds are always active. Since the mind is like a muscle which becomes stronger through continual exercise, the mental exercise caused by curiosity makes your mind stronger and stronger.

### It makes your mind observant of new ideas

When you are curious about something, your mind expects and anticipates new ideas related to it. When the ideas come they will soon be recognized. Without curiosity, the ideas may pass right in front of you and yet you miss them because your mind is not prepared to recognize them. Just think, how many great ideas may have lost due to lack of curiosity?

### It opens up new worlds and possibilities

By being curious you will be able to see new worlds and possibilities which are normally not visible. They are hidden behind the surface of normal life, and it takes a curious mind to look beneath the surface and discover these new worlds and possibilities.

### It brings excitement into your life

The life of curious people is far from boring. It's neither dull nor routine. There are always new things that attract their attention, there are always new 'toys' to play with. Instead of being bored, curious people have an adventurous life.
