# No change without a failing test

If it ain't broke don't fix it goes the old saying. This is often used to resist changes, but resisting change isn't all bad. In fact, changes are risky and should only be done if there is sufficient reason. A broken test case is proof of a bug (if the test case makes sense) and demanding reproducible breakage before undertaking a risky change is a good recipe to avoid awkward discussions.
