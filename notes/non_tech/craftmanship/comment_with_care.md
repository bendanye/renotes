# Comment With Care

Getting the comments right is as hard (and important) as getting the source code right. Having too many comments in a file can be as detrimental to maintainability as having too few [citation needed], comments can be useless and the worst are incorrect or misleading.

Source code comments can assert intellectual property ownership and licensing terms.
