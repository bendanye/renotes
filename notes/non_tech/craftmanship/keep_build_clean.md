# Keep the build clean

When we start a new project from scratch, the build is clean and initially there are no warnings, no problems. As the code base grows, we start to see warnings in the build log. If we don't pay attention, the warnings start piling up.

When there's a lot of noise, it's much harder to find the warning that I really want to read among the hundreds of warnings I don't care about.
