# Be great developer

- Attention to small details
- understand how it works under the hood
- don't say you are "some techstack" developer. Just say you are developer
- don't afraid to learn something that is necessary
- don't stick to one career (for example backend developer), explore other like full stack developer, information security and etc

## My perspective

- Always test regardless how small the change is
- don't take any shortcut for testing. Test full flow even if it takes long time
- Understand the output of a process. From there you can analyze what to take note in particular
- Convey the what and delegate the how
- Code should show how, comment should show why
