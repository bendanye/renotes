# Code Smell 14 - God Objects

TL;DR: Don't take too many responsibilities.

"God class—or, alternatively, god object—is an anti-pattern that consists of having a class that does too much. A god class is usually a huge class that concentrates a lot of responsibilities, controls and oversees many different objects, and effectively does everything in the application."
