# The Liar

(aka Evergreen Tests, Success Against All Odds3). A test doesn’t validate any behaviour and passes in every scenario. Any new bug introduced in the code will never be discovered by this test. It was probably created after the implementation was finished, so the author of this test couldn’t know whether the test actually tests something.
