# Excessive Setup

(aka Mother Hen). A test that requires a lot of work to set up in order to even begin testing. Sometimes several hundred lines of code are used to setup the environment for one test, with several objects involved, which can make it difficult to really ascertain what is being tested due to the “noise” of all of the setup.
