# Tests

* Stubs
* Mock
* Spy
* Dummy

* Don't reproduce logic
* No complex logic
    - input and expect constants
    - improve Maintainability
    - avoid bug
* Gray box testing
    - test against the interface
    - unit tests are not friends
    - but test edge cases
* Code coverage
    - goal: "good enough"
    - document gaps
* Strong typing
    - focused tests
    - less corner cases
* Readability
    - understand why test fails
    - documentation
    - maintenance
* Use design principles
    - meaningful name
    - abstraction
    - short test cases
* One fact per test case
    - single responsibility principle
    - one reason to fail
    - focus on unit under test
* Usability check
    - convoluted test cases indicate problematic code
