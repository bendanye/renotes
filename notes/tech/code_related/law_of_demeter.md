# Law of Demeter (lod)

The Law of Demeter (LoD) or principle of least knowledge is a design guideline for developing software, particularly object-oriented programs. In its general form, the LoD is a specific case of loose coupling.

- promote loosely coupled code
- make testing easier
- tdd/bdd, single responsibility, Dependency injection/inversion is the way to go
- DI can be easily misused and doesn't require a library/framework
