# Integrate frequently and continuously

"Continuous, frequent integration delivers fast feedback, so you find out about incompatible changes early. The confidence and safety net from this fast feedback encourages refactoring to maintain simplicity. Frequent integration helps keep change sets small, which reduces deployment risk and makes debugging easier. While it sometimes requires extra effort to make work-in-progress integratable, it increases the overall team efficiency and flow by avoiding complex merges, and achieving higher simplicity in the change and deployment processes."
