# Deploy earlier and continuously

"Deploying early to production gives us confidence that the system is production-ready and we don’t have significant work (and re-work) hidden in the backlog. We also find any problems early. Deploying frequently — whether features are ready to release or not, whether there were changes or not — brings forward any problems with deployment.

It increases confidence in automation and processes and thereby reduces deployment risk."
