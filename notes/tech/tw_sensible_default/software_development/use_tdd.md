# Use test-driven development

"TDD drives the design of software from the ‘outside-in’, and we end up with better encapsulation and modularity (aspects of clean code), making it easier to understand. Just enough complexity should be added to make the code pass tests (simplicity). The resulting automated test suite can be run whenever we make a change so we get fast feedback to support confidence. By sharing responsibility for test automation with the whole team supports repeatability."
