# Have fast and verified automated builds

"We need very fast feedback to know that changes we’re making have not introduced any defects. That build process must be fully automated so that it delivers repeatability and we don’t have late discovery of differences caused by manual steps. Ensuring that the build is reliable and fast allows us to introduce change in small batches and get earlier integration and feedback."
