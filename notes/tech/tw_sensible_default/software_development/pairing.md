# Develop in pairs

"Pair-programming provides extremely fast feedback on code and design, reducing rework and leading to more clean code and simplicity. Teams that pair regularly exhibit better repeatability as we break down code ownership, have more consistency, and can deal better with team changes and absences. Pairing prioritizes team efficiency and flow over a single individualâ€™s speed by improving collective code ownership, and reducing work in progress."
