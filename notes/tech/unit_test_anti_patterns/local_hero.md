# Local Hero

(aka Hidden Dependency, Operating System Evangelist, Wait and See, Environmental Vandal). A test case that is dependent on something specific to the development environment it was written on, in order to run. The result is that the test passes on development boxes, but fails when someone attempts to run it elsewhere.
