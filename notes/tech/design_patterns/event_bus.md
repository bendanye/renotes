# Event Bus

"The idea of an Event bus is actually quite similar to the Bus studied in Networking (Bus Topology). You have some kind of pipeline and computers connected to it, and whenever one of them sends a message, itâ€™s dispatched to all of the others. Then, they decide if they want to consume the given message or just discard it."
