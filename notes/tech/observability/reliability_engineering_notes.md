# Reliability Engineering Notes

## Slide 1: Implementing Reliability Testing

### Business Benefits
- **Early Issue Detection**: Find problems before customers do
- **Increased Confidence**: Better team preparedness for incidents
- **Reduced Recovery Time**: Faster MTTR during real outages
- **Trust Building**: Demonstrate resilience to stakeholders

### Practical Implementation
- **Start Simple**: Begin with critical paths and core functions
- **Game Days**: Schedule cross-team incident response exercises
- **Continuous Process**: Iterate on tests as your architecture evolves
- **Documentation**: Track findings and improvements

## Slide 2: Failure Mode Analysis (FMA)

### Proactive Identification
- Recognize potential weaknesses before outages occur
- Use checklists, post-mortems, and dependency mapping
- Identify high-impact risks and allocate resources efficiently
- Distinguish between rare/high-impact and common/low-impact failures

### Effective Mitigation
- Architect for graceful degradation and fallback strategies
- Enhance observability for quick detection
- Implement immediate failover and data replication
- Document potential risks to guide resolution

## Slide 7: Understanding Reliability and Resiliency

- Failures are *inevitable* in distributed systems.
- Workloads must **detect**, **withstand**, and **recover** from failures within *acceptable* timeframes.
- Ensuring availability for users to access workloads as promised.
- Failures have an impact on *revenue*, *reputation*, and *customer trust*.

## Slide 8: Financial Impact of Downtime

- **Revenue Loss**: Downtime can cost businesses over $1 million per hour, especially for e-commerce and online services.
- **Increased Expenses**: Includes emergency maintenance, staff overtime, and potential penalties for SLA breaches.
- **Legal Liabilities**: Potential lawsuits from customers or clients affected by downtime.
- **Insurance Challenges**: Downtime can affect insurance coverage and premiums.
- **Operational Costs**: Additional costs for restoring systems, data recovery, and preventive measures to avoid future downtime.
