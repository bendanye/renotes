# Recovery Point Objective (RPO), Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective) are key metrics in disaster recovery and business continuity planning. RPO defines the maximum amount of data loss an organization can tolerate, while RTO defines the maximum acceptable downtime before a system or application is restored to normal operations.

## RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
- RPO represents the maximum acceptable amount of data loss in a disaster recovery scenario. 
- It's typically measured in time (e.g., hours, days) and indicates the time between the last successful backup and the point of recovery. 
- A lower RPO means less data loss during a recovery, but it may require more frequent backups and more complex recovery strategies.

## RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
- RTO is the maximum acceptable downtime before a system or application is restored to normal operations after a disaster or disruption. 
- It's measured in time (e.g., minutes, hours) and indicates the target timeframe for recovery. 
- A lower RTO means faster recovery and less downtime, but it may require more robust disaster recovery infrastructure and procedures.
