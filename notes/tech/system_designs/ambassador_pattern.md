# Ambassador Pattern

"The Ambassador Pattern in distributed systems is a design strategy used to manage communication between different parts of a system. In complex systems, services often need to interact with external resources, which can be slow or unreliable. The Ambassador Pattern acts as a middleman or ambassador that handles these interactions. It simplifies communication, manages errors, and ensures that the system remains stable even if external services fail or behave unpredictably. This pattern is particularly useful in microservices architectures, where different components need to work together seamlessly, despite potential external challenges."
