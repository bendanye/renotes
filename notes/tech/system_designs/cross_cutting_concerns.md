# Cross Cutting Concerns

"Cross-cutting concerns are aspects of a program that affect several modules, without the possibility of being encapsulated in any of them. These concerns often cannot be cleanly decomposed from the rest of the system in both the design and implementation, and can result in either scattering (code duplication), tangling (significant dependencies between systems), or both."
