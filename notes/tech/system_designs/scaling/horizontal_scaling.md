# Horizontal Scaling

Involves adding more processing units or phyiscal machines to your server or database. It involves growing the number of nodes in the cluster, reducing the responsibilities of each member node by spreading the key space wider and providing additional end-points for client connections. Horizontal Scaling has been historically much more used for high level of computing and for application and services.

Although this does not alter the capacity of each individual node, the load is decreased due to the distribution between separate server nodes.
