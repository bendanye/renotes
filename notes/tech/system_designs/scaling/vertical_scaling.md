# Vertical Scaling

Refers to adding more resources (CPU/RAM/DISK) to your server (database or application server is still remains one) as on demand.

Vertical Scaling is most commonly used in applications and products of middle-range as well as small and middle-sized companies. One of the most common examples of Virtual Scaling is to buy an expensive hardware and use it as a Virtual Machine hypervisor (VMWare ESX).

Vertical Scaling usually means upgrade of server hardware. Some of the reasons to scale vertically includes increasing IOPS (Input / Ouput Operations), amplifying CPU/RAM capacity, as well as disk capacity.

However, even after using virtualization, whenever an improved performance is targeted, the risk for downtimes with it is much higher than using horizontal scaling.
