# Reverse vs Forward proxy

"A forward proxy deals with client traffic, regulating and securing it. In contrast, a reverse proxy shields servers by handling client requests, ensuring they reach the right server, and returning the results to clients, who are unaware of the server's direct involvement."

"In other words, the main difference between a forward proxy and a reverse proxy lies in their primary functions and the direction of traffic flow. A forward proxy, also known as a proxy server, operates between clients and external systems, regulating traffic, masking client IP addresses, and enforcing security policies.

On the other hand, a reverse proxy is positioned between clients and servers, acting as a protective barrier for servers by accepting client requests, forwarding them to the appropriate server, and returning the results to the client. Unlike a forward proxy, the client is unaware that another server has processed its request, as the reverse proxy handles the communication and appears to the client as the sole point of contact."
