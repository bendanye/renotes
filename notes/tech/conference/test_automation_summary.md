# Test Automation and Module Testing Insights

## Summary (from Devoxx Poland talk)

- Focus on testing modules
- Test the behaviour (black box), not implementation
- Prepare sample test data for the module, reuse it
- Hide API for integration under meaningful methods
- Build a small DSL to express your requirements
- Think about explaining the behaviour at a whiteboard
- Extract code that slows down your integration tests into self-tested jars
- Work with 30sec budget for unit, 3min budget for integration from the start
- Tests == specifications == requirements
- Expect refining requirements to be a hard job, pay attention
