# Random Notes (4)

---

## A test is not a unit test if:
- It talks to the **database**
- It communicates **across the network**
- It touches the **file system**
- It **can't run at the same time** as any of your other unit tests
- You have to do **special things** to your **environment** (such as editing config files) to run it

*— Michael Feathers*

## Clarity is key

- Don’t deceive your users or your management  
- Especially, don’t deceive yourself  
- Treat your code addiction  
- Build a stack of talents/skills  
- Learn to listen

## Why API Keys?

**Secure**
- Revocation is typically easier (and self-serve)
- Opaque (nobody can decode and inspect your claims)

**Improve your TTFC**
- These companies obsess about developer experience
- Measure Time to First Call
- Conversion rate matters
