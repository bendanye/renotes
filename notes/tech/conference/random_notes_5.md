## ✅ Thinking in Systems
- How do we enable fast feedback loops for developers, security, etc.?
- Where are the bottlenecks and points of leverage in our system of value creation?  
  How do we improve the team’s metrics?
- How do I get better at my job? What do I need to learn?

## ❌ NOT! Thinking in Systems
- All developers should maximize their individual outputs.
- Let’s reward the developers with the most PRs (and punish the ones with the least).
- “Our developers are not good enough.”  
  “Developers don’t listen.”  
  “The problem is with that team.”  
  “We need to hire only 10x engineers.”
