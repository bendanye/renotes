# Random Notes (1)

## Trunk Based Development (TBD) Benefits

- Small steps
- Fast feedback
- Avoid merge hell
- Reducing risk
- Faster integration, fewer queues
- Collective ownership
- Better quality code

---

## Continous Integration Certification Test

1. Every developer commit at least daily to the shared mainline
2. Every commit triggers an automated build and test
3. if build and test fails, its repaired within ten minutes

## What Should We Automate?

- Is the test or task going to be repeated? How often?
- How much time could be saved?
- Are the requirements, the test, or task low risk, stable, or unlikely to change often?
- Is the test or task subject to human error?
- Is the test or task time consuming? Does it contain significant downtime between test steps?
- Is the test or task repetitive?
