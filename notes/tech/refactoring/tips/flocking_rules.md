# Flocking rules

The flocking rules are an small set of rules for refactoring code. The idea is make small incremental changes that allows you obtain precise error messages when something goes wrong, so if you find and error, you can revert it and make a smaller one. The steps are the following:

1. Select the things that are most alike.
2. Find the smallest difference between them.
3. Make the simplest change that will remove that difference.
