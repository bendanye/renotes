# SMART: Principles for building robust test scripts

This mnemonic helps design test scripts that are scalable, maintainable, and practical.

## Standalone

Each script should run independently with minimal dependencies.

## Modular/Maintainable

Code should be modular and easy to maintain.

## Appropriate

Fit the test to the actual project needs; avoid over-engineering or trying to automate everything.

## Reusable

Build scripts that can be reused across tests or projects.

## Testable & Traceable

Ensure easy debugging and traceability between tests and test results.
