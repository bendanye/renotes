# Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC)

## Dependency Injection (DI)

DI is a design pattern that implements IoC by injecting dependencies into a class instead of the class creating them.

## Inversion of Control (IoC)

IoC is a broader principle where the control of object creation, configuration, and lifecycle is given to an external framework or container instead of being managed by the program itself.
